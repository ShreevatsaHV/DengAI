Predicting disease spread using Machine Learning techniques of Pre-processing, Feature Engineering, Deep Learning, Gradient boosting, Random forest and Logistic regression using Python as the programming language.

Analyzed the data set obtained from drivendata.org
(https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/), done
the necessary pre-processing on it and then have used multiple models to predict the total
cases for any given condition.
